# Three Levels of Product Work

## Overview

The Three Levels of Product Work framework reveals that all product work operates on three distinct levels: Impact, Execution, and Optics. Understanding these levels helps product managers recognize where they're actually spending their time versus where they should be spending it.

Most PMs dramatically over-index on Optics (how work is perceived) while under-investing in Impact (actual outcomes created). This happens because optics work is visible and immediately rewarded, while impact work is harder to see and takes longer to prove. The framework helps you consciously rebalance toward impact.

This isn't about eliminating optics or execution work - both are necessary. It's about understanding the purpose each serves and ensuring you're not confusing activity for achievement.

## How It Works

### Level 1: Impact
**Definition:** The actual outcomes your work creates for users and the business.

This is what truly matters in the long run. Impact is measured by:
- Did user behavior change?
- Did business metrics move?
- Did we solve a real problem?
- Did we create lasting value?

Impact is often invisible in the short term. A feature might ship (execution) and get praised (optics) but create no impact if users don't adopt it or it doesn't solve their problem.

**Examples of Impact work:**
- Deep customer research that uncovers a critical insight
- A simple feature change that dramatically improves retention
- Killing a project that wasn't going to move the needle
- Making a hard prioritization decision that focuses the team

### Level 2: Execution
**Definition:** The quality and efficiency of how you build and ship.

Execution is about the craft of getting things done well:
- Are specs clear and complete?
- Is the team unblocked and moving fast?
- Is the code quality high?
- Are we shipping on time?

Good execution is necessary but not sufficient. You can execute brilliantly on the wrong thing and create zero impact.

**Examples of Execution work:**
- Writing detailed PRDs
- Running efficient meetings
- Coordinating cross-functional teams
- Managing timelines and dependencies
- QA and bug fixes

### Level 3: Optics
**Definition:** How your work is perceived by stakeholders, leadership, and others.

Optics is about visibility, credit, and perception:
- Do people know what you're working on?
- Are your achievements visible to leadership?
- Is the narrative around your work positive?
- Are you seen as effective?

Optics isn't inherently bad - you need some optics work to maintain influence and get resources. But it's a trap when it becomes the primary focus.

**Examples of Optics work:**
- Status update emails
- Demo presentations
- All-hands announcements
- Slide decks for executives
- "Launch theater" (big announcements for small features)

## The Danger Zone

The framework reveals a common anti-pattern: **Optics masquerading as Impact.**

Signs you're in this trap:
- Spending more time on launch announcements than on measuring launch results
- Celebrating feature completion rather than user adoption
- Optimizing for executive visibility rather than user value
- Choosing projects based on "visibility" rather than importance
- Writing long docs that no one reads to appear thorough

**The brutal truth:** You can have excellent execution and great optics while creating zero impact. Many products ship with fanfare, get praised internally, and quietly fail in the market.

## When to Use

**Use this framework when:**
- Planning your week or quarter - audit where your time goes
- Evaluating project success - did it create impact or just optics?
- Making prioritization decisions - which option creates more impact?
- Reflecting on your career - are you building impact or optics skills?
- Coaching other PMs - help them see the difference

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- "Is this high-impact work, or am I doing this for visibility?"
- "If no one ever knew I did this, would it still matter?"
- "Am I measuring real outcomes or proxy metrics?"
- "What would it take to turn this execution into impact?"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Dismissing all optics work
Some optics work is necessary and legitimate. You need people to understand your work to get resources, support, and collaboration. The goal isn't zero optics - it's appropriate optics.

### 2. Confusing execution metrics for impact
"We shipped 15 features this quarter" is execution. "User retention improved 8%" is impact. Shipping volume feels productive but says nothing about value creation.

### 3. Only doing what's visible
Some of the highest-impact work is invisible:
- Killing a bad project before it wastes resources
- Having a hard conversation that unblocks a team
- Doing the research that prevents a wrong decision
- Saying no to a stakeholder request

### 4. Not investing in any optics
If leadership doesn't know about your impact, you won't get promoted, resourced, or supported. Some strategic optics work is part of being effective.

### 5. Judging others' optics work harshly
Everyone needs to do some optics work. Before judging a colleague for "playing politics," consider whether they're doing the appropriate amount of visibility work to be effective.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** PM reviewing their calendar for the past month

| Activity | Hours | Level |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Exec status updates | 8 | Optics |
| Writing PRDs | 12 | Execution |
| Team standups | 10 | Execution |
| Customer interviews | 2 | Impact |
| Analyzing metrics | 3 | Impact |
| Launch announcement prep | 6 | Optics |
| Strategy planning | 4 | Impact |
| Stakeholder alignment meetings | 8 | Mixed (Optics/Execution) |
| Bug triage | 5 | Execution |

**Analysis:**
- Impact: 9 hours (18%)
- Execution: 27 hours (54%)
- Optics: 14 hours (28%)

**Insight:** This PM is spending less than 20% of their time on impact work. The rebalancing goal might be:
- Cut exec status updates to 4 hours (send async updates instead)
- Reduce launch announcement prep (does the feature really need this?)
- Double customer interview time
- Add time for deeper metric analysis

## Key Quotes

> "Most PMs optimize for optics without realizing it. They're doing what gets noticed rather than what creates value."

> "The best PMs I know spend 50%+ of their time on impact work. Average PMs spend 50%+ on execution and optics."

> "If you have to choose between doing high-impact work that no one sees and low-impact work that everyone praises, choose the high-impact work. Your career will be better for it in the long run."

> "Execution without impact is just motion. Optics without impact is just theater."
