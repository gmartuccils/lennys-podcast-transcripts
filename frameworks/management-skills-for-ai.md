**Best for:** Working effectively with AI tools and organizing AI-enabled teams

## Overview

Management Skills for AI is a framework for applying traditional management principles to working with AI - both using AI tools effectively and structuring teams in an AI-augmented world. The core insight: the same skills that make great people managers make great AI managers. Defining outcomes clearly, understanding strengths, providing context, and orchestrating process.

As AI tools become more capable, every knowledge worker becomes a "manager of AI" - directing AI assistants, reviewing AI outputs, and combining AI work with human judgment. Teams that develop these skills will dramatically outperform those that don't.

This framework helps individuals work better with AI tools and helps organizations restructure for an AI-augmented future.

## How It Works

### The Parallel: Managing People vs. Managing AI

| Managing People | Managing AI |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Define clear goals | Define clear success criteria |
| Understand their strengths | Know which models excel at what |
| Provide context | Give relevant context in prompts |
| Give feedback | Iterate on prompts based on outputs |
| Review their work | Review AI outputs before using |
| Orchestrate collaboration | Chain tools and models together |

### Individual AI Management Skills

**1. Defining Outcomes Clearly**
AI needs crystal-clear success criteria. Vague instructions produce vague results.

*Poor:* "Write something about our product"
*Better:* "Write a 200-word product description for software engineers, highlighting the API capabilities, with a professional tone"

*The clearer your definition of success, the better the output.*

**2. Understanding Model Strengths**
Different AI models and tools have different strengths:

- GPT-4 vs. Claude vs. others (different capabilities)
- Chat interfaces vs. APIs (different use cases)
- Specialized tools for code, images, data

*Develop intuition for which tool fits which task.*

**3. Providing Context**
The more relevant context you provide, the better the output:

- Background information
- Examples of good outputs
- Constraints and requirements
- The "why" behind the request

*Don't assume the AI knows what you know. Make context explicit.*

**4. Iterating Based on Output**
Treat AI as a collaborative process, not a vending machine:

- Review outputs critically
- Identify what's wrong or missing
- Refine your prompt
- Run again
- Repeat until quality is sufficient

*Good AI work is iterative, not one-shot.*

**5. Verifying and Editing**
AI outputs need human review:

- Check facts and accuracy
- Verify reasoning
- Edit for voice and style
- Add judgment AI lacks

*AI assists; humans are accountable.*

### Team Structures for AI

**The "Builder" Mindset**
AI is blurring traditional role boundaries. Individual contributors can do more:

- PMs can prototype with AI coding tools
- Designers can generate variations quickly
- Engineers can get design suggestions
- Everyone can draft content

*Traditional handoffs become collaborations. Everyone becomes more full-stack.*

**Smaller, Senior Teams**
When individual output increases 2-5x with AI:

- Teams can be smaller
- Senior judgment becomes more valuable
- Junior "grunt work" is automated
- Quality/taste matters more than volume

**Changed Role Composition:**
- Fewer specialists, more generalists
- Less coordination overhead
- More emphasis on judgment and taste
- Review and curation become key skills

### The AI-Augmented Workflow

**Step 1: Identify AI-Suitable Tasks**
Not everything should involve AI. Good candidates:
- Drafting and ideation
- Research and summarization
- Code generation and review
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Repetitive, well-defined tasks

**Step 2: Design the Human-AI Split**
For each task:
- What does AI do?
- What do humans do?
- Where is the handoff?
- Who has final authority?

**Step 3: Build Feedback Loops**
Improve AI usage over time:
- Track which prompts work best
- Share successful approaches
- Learn from AI mistakes
- Build prompt libraries

## When to Use

**These skills matter when:**
- Using AI tools in daily work
- Building AI-powered products
- Restructuring teams for AI
- Evaluating AI tool adoption
- Training teams on AI usage

**Signs you need better AI management:**
- AI outputs require extensive editing
- Different team members get wildly different results
- AI usage is inconsistent across team
- No evaluation of AI output quality
- Over-reliance or under-reliance on AI

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using AI as a crutch
Accepting AI output without critical review leads to errors and mediocrity. AI assists; it doesn't replace judgment.

### 2. Ignoring AI entirely
Teams that don't develop AI skills will be outpaced by those that do. This is a capability to develop, not a fad to wait out.

### 3. One-shot prompting
Expecting perfect output on the first try. Good AI work is iterative - run, review, refine, repeat.

### 4. No prompt optimization
Using the same basic prompts without improvement. Prompts are like code - they should be versioned, tested, and optimized.

### 5. Not sharing learnings
When one person figures out a good AI approach, the whole team should benefit. Build knowledge bases of effective prompts.

### 6. Replacing judgment with AI
AI can inform decisions but shouldn't make them. Human judgment, taste, and accountability remain essential.

### 7. Same team structure
If AI increases individual productivity 2x+, team structures should change. Keeping old structures wastes the advantage.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** Product team integrating AI tools

**Individual Level:**

*Before:* PM writes PRD manually (4 hours)
*After:* PM outlines key points, uses AI to draft, edits and refines (1.5 hours)

*Prompt approach:*
```
I'm writing a PRD for [feature]. Here's the context:
- Problem we're solving: [X]
- Target users: [Y]
- Key requirements: [Z]
- Constraints: [A]

Write a PRD with sections for: Problem Statement, Goals, Non-Goals,
User Stories, Success Metrics, and Open Questions.

Keep it concise and focused on decisions that need to be made.
```

*Review process:* PM reviews draft, corrects any inaccuracies, adds judgment calls AI couldn't make, fills in details from their knowledge.

**Team Level:**

*Before:* 8-person product team (2 PMs, 3 engineers, 2 designers, 1 researcher)

*After restructure:* 5-person team with expanded capabilities
- 1 PM (uses AI for docs, data analysis)
- 2 engineers (use AI for code generation, review)
- 1 designer (uses AI for ideation, variations)
- 1 PM/researcher hybrid (uses AI for synthesis)

*Result:* Similar output, faster velocity, higher senior density, more time for strategic work.

## The Future of Work with AI

**What becomes more valuable:**
- Taste and judgment (what's good vs. bad)
- Strategic thinking (what should we do)
- Relationship skills (human connections)
- Domain expertise (knowing the context)
- Quality standards (catching errors)

**What becomes less scarce:**
- Basic drafting and content creation
- Routine analysis
- First-pass research
- Code boilerplate
- Standard designs and variations

**The winning combination:**
Human judgment and taste + AI capability and speed

## Key Quotes

> "Everyone becomes a manager - of AI. The same skills that make you good at managing people will make you good at directing AI: clear outcomes, relevant context, iterative feedback."

> "If you don't have a PM on the team, communication becomes everyone's responsibility. If you don't have a data analyst, figuring out metrics is everyone's responsibility. This actually makes everyone more well-rounded."

> "AI doesn't replace judgment. It amplifies the judgment you have. If your judgment is good, AI makes you faster. If your judgment is poor, AI helps you make poor decisions faster."

> "The question isn't 'will AI take my job?' It's 'how do I become the person who's great at working with AI?' That person will always be valuable."
