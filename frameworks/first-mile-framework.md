# First Mile Framework

**Best for:** Optimizing onboarding and first-time user experiences

## Overview

The First Mile Framework focuses design and product attention on the very beginning of the user experience - the first moments after someone discovers your product. The insight: users are "lazy, vain, and selfish" (in a descriptive, not pejorative sense), and if you don't capture them immediately, you lose them forever.

Most products over-invest in features for power users and under-invest in the experience of brand new users. But no one becomes a power user without surviving the first mile. The framework flips priorities: 80% of onboarding effort should go to the first 20% of the experience.

This is particularly relevant in a world of infinite alternatives. Users don't invest in learning your product - they leave and find something else.

## How It Works

### The Three User Truths

Users are:

**1. Lazy**
They will not invest effort to understand your product. If it's not immediately clear what to do, they leave.

*Implications:*
- Minimize steps to first value
- Don't require reading instructions
- Make the next action obvious
- Remove unnecessary choices

**2. Vain**
They want to look and feel good immediately. The first impression matters.

*Implications:*
- Make them feel smart, not dumb
- Provide early wins
- Show them their progress
- Make the product aesthetically pleasing from the start

**3. Selfish**
They care about their specific need, not your product's full potential.

*Implications:*
- Get to their use case immediately
- Don't show features they don't need
- Personalize when possible
- Focus on their goal, not your features

### The First Mile Principles

**1. 80/20 Onboarding**
Invest 80% of your onboarding effort in the first 20% of the experience.

Most teams do the opposite: a quick welcome screen, then assume users will figure it out. The framework inverts this: obsess over the first 30 seconds, first minute, first session.

**2. Time to Value**
The only metric that matters early: how quickly do users experience real value?

Not how long they stay. Not how many features they see. How quickly do they go "oh, this is useful."

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
Don't show everything at once. Reveal complexity only as users need it.

*Example:*
- Day 1: Core feature only
- Week 1: Surface related features
- Month 1: Advanced capabilities

**4. Default to Done**
Set defaults that make the product immediately useful without configuration.

*Example:*
- Pre-fill forms with intelligent defaults
- Start with templates, not blank pages
- Assume common use case and optimize for it

**5. Celebrate Early Wins**
Acknowledge user progress to reinforce engagement.

*Example:*
- "You've created your first project!"
- Progress bars during setup
- Achievement moments

### The Onboarding Audit

For each step in your first mile, ask:

1. **Why does the user need to do this?**
   If you can't answer clearly, cut it.

2. **Can this be defaulted or automated?**
   Reduce decisions for the user.

3. **Does this feel like progress or friction?**
   Progress should be visible.

4. **What if the user leaves right here?**
   Minimize drop-off risk at every step.

5. **Is this bringing them closer to value?**
   Every step should earn its place.

## When to Use

**First Mile thinking is critical when:**
- Activation metrics are weak
- Users sign up but don't return
- Onboarding surveys show confusion
- Support tickets are about getting started
- Competitors win on "ease of use"

**Signs your first mile needs work:**
- Funnel analysis shows early drop-off
- Users don't reach core features
- Time to value is measured in days, not minutes
- You've added features but engagement hasn't improved

## Common Mistakes

### 1. The grand tour
Showing users every feature on first login. This overwhelms, not helps. Users are lazy - they don't want the tour.

### 2. Feature-first instead of value-first
"Let me show you our analytics dashboard" vs. "Let me help you understand your customers."

### 3. Required reading
Making users read documentation or watch videos before they can start. They won't. Design the product so they don't need to.

### 4. Blank slate paralysis
Starting users with a blank screen and no guidance. Add templates, examples, or default content.

### 5. Deferring value
"Once you set everything up, this product is amazing." Users never get there. Find ways to deliver value during setup.

### 6. Measuring signup, not activation
Many users sign up and never return. Optimize for activated users (those who experience value), not registrations.

### 7. Optimizing late funnel
Teams often optimize feature adoption for existing users while ignoring the flood of people who never make it that far.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** Project management tool redesigning onboarding

**Before:**
1. Sign up form (email, password, company name, role, team size)
2. Verify email
3. Choose plan
4. Welcome screen with 8-feature overview
5. Blank dashboard with "Create your first project"
6. Project creation form with 12 fields
7. Empty project

**Drop-off:** 70% of signups never create a project

**After - First Mile Redesign:**

1. **Sign up:** Email only (one field)
2. **Immediate:** "What's one thing you need to get done?" (text input)
3. **Auto-created:** Their input becomes a project with that title
4. **First task:** "Add your first task to this project" (appears in project)
5. **Win:** "You've started your first project!"
6. **Progressive:** Team features introduced only after 3 tasks added

**Changes made:**
- Removed 5 fields from signup (collect later)
- Removed email verification gate (verify after they're hooked)
- Removed plan selection (free tier by default)
- Removed feature tour (introduce features contextually)
- Created project from first input (no blank slate)

**Result:** Activation (create first project) increased from 30% to 65%

## Advanced Tactics

### Personalized First Mile
Ask one question that tailors the experience:
- "What's your role?" → Show relevant templates
- "What are you trying to accomplish?" → Guide to the right feature
- "Have you used tools like this before?" → Adjust complexity

### Social Proof in First Mile
Show that others like them succeeded:
- "100,000 teams manage projects with us"
- "Here's how [similar company] uses this feature"

### Defer Everything Possible
Ask yourself: "Does this absolutely have to happen before they can get value?"
- Payment: Often can be deferred (free trial)
- Profile completion: Can happen later
- Team setup: Can be single-player first
- Integrations: Can add after seeing value

### Reversal Points
Identify where you lose users and work backwards:
- 50% drop at step 3? Make step 3 easier or optional.
- Most activated users did X? Guide everyone to X faster.

## Key Quotes

> "Users are lazy, vain, and selfish. This isn't criticism - it's recognition of how everyone behaves with new products. Design for this reality."

> "Most products invest 20% in the first mile and 80% in advanced features. Flip that. The first mile is where you win or lose."

> "Every field in your signup form is a reason to leave. Every step before value is a chance to abandon. Minimize, minimize, minimize."

> "The question isn't 'how do we show users our product?' It's 'how quickly can users experience value?' Everything else is friction."
