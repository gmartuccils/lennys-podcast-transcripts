# Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

**Best for:** Understanding the real motivation behind customer decisions

## Overview

Jobs to Be Done is a framework for understanding customer behavior that focuses on the progress customers are trying to make in specific circumstances, rather than on customer demographics or product features. The core insight: people don't buy products, they "hire" products to do a job.

When you understand the "job" customers are hiring your product for, you can build something that does that job better than alternatives. This shifts the question from "what features should we build?" to "what progress are customers trying to make, and how can we help them make it?"

Bob Moesta's approach emphasizes the context surrounding decisions - the specific circumstances that cause someone to seek a solution. This context is often more important than the features themselves.

## How It Works

### The Core Formula

**Job to Be Done = Struggling Moment + Desired Progress**

A "job" arises when someone experiences a struggle (the push) and imagines a better state (the pull). The product is hired to bridge the gap.

### The Four Forces

Every decision to adopt a new solution involves four competing forces:

```
        FORCES FOR CHANGE                    FORCES AGAINST CHANGE
        ==================                    ====================

    Push of Current Situation            Anxiety of New Solution
    (Pain with status quo)              (Fear it won't work)
              ↓                                   ↑
                        DECISION
              ↓                                   ↑
    Pull of New Solution                 Habit of Present
    (Attraction of alternative)         (Comfort with current)
```

**Push:** The pain, frustration, or limitation with the current situation. "This is broken/slow/hard/expensive."

**Pull:** The attraction of the new solution. The promise of a better future state.

**Anxiety:** The fear that comes with trying something new. "What if it doesn't work? What if I waste money/time? What if it's hard to learn?"

**Habit:** The comfort of the familiar. "I know how to do it the old way. It's not great, but it's predictable."

**Key insight:** For someone to switch, the combined strength of Push + Pull must overcome the combined strength of Anxiety + Habit.

### The Timeline

JTBD research focuses on reconstructing the decision timeline:

1. **First Thought:** When did you first think about making a change?
2. **Passive Looking:** When did you start noticing alternatives?
3. **Active Looking:** When did you start actively searching?
4. **Deciding:** What triggered the final decision?
5. **Consuming/Using:** What happened after purchase?

Understanding this timeline reveals the true "job" and the context that created it.

## The JTBD Interview

### The Technique

JTBD interviews work backwards from a decision to understand what caused it. The goal is to reconstruct the story of how someone came to "hire" a product.

**Starting point:** Find someone who recently made the decision you're studying (bought your product, switched from a competitor, churned, etc.)

**Opening question:** "Take me back to when you first started thinking about [buying/switching/canceling]. What was going on in your life?"

### Interview Flow

1. **Set the context**
   - "Where were you when you first thought about this?"
   - "What time of day was it?"
   - "What were you doing right before?"

2. **Explore the struggling moment**
   - "What wasn't working?"
   - "How long had this been bothering you?"
   - "What made it intolerable now versus before?"

3. **Understand the search**
   - "What did you look for first?"
   - "What alternatives did you consider?"
   - "What made some options more attractive than others?"

4. **Reconstruct the decision**
   - "When did you decide on this solution?"
   - "What almost stopped you?"
   - "What would have made you choose differently?"

5. **Capture the criteria**
   - "What were you looking for?"
   - "What would success look like?"
   - "What would failure look like?"

### Interview Tips from Bob Moesta

**Go slow in the beginning.** The context and struggling moment are everything. Don't rush to the decision.

**Look for contradictions.** When someone says "I wanted X" but did Y, explore the gap. That's where insight lives.

**Dig into emotions.** "How did that make you feel?" is more valuable than "what did you think?"

**Ask for specifics.** "Walk me through that day" is better than "tell me about your process."

**Don't accept the first answer.** "What else?" and "Tell me more about that" reveal deeper truths.

## When to Use

**Ideal situations:**
- Entering a new market and need to understand buyer motivation
- Product isn't growing and you don't know why
- Competing against unexpected alternatives
- Need to differentiate positioning
- Trying to reduce churn
- Building a new product category

**Questions JTBD answers:**
- Why do people really buy our product?
- What alternatives are we actually competing against?
- What circumstances trigger someone to look for a solution?
- Why do some people buy and others don't?
- What anxieties prevent adoption?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing the job with the solution
"I needed a drill" is not a job. "I needed a hole in my wall" is closer. "I needed to hang a picture to make my new house feel like home" is the job.

**Test:** Can you imagine multiple different products that could do this job?

### 2. Focusing on demographics instead of context
"25-34 year olds in urban areas" tells you nothing about why people buy. "First-time managers who just got promoted and feel overwhelmed" tells you about the job.

### 3. Asking people what they want
People are terrible at predicting their future behavior. They're much better at describing past decisions. Always interview about actual decisions, not hypothetical ones.

### 4. Ignoring the forces against change
Understanding why people don't switch is as valuable as understanding why they do. Anxiety and habit are often stronger than push and pull.

### 5. Assuming one job per product
Products often serve multiple jobs. A CRM might be hired to "help me remember customer details" by one user and "prove to my boss I'm making calls" by another. Segment by job, not demographics.

### 6. Stopping at the functional job
Jobs have functional, emotional, and social dimensions:
- **Functional:** "I need to get expense reports done faster"
- **Emotional:** "I need to feel less stressed about admin work"
- **Social:** "I need my boss to see me as organized"

All three matter.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** Understanding why people switch from spreadsheets to project management software

**JTBD Interview findings:**

**Struggling Moment:**
- "I had three projects going and couldn't remember what I promised to whom"
- "I missed a deadline because it was buried in a spreadsheet"
- "My boss asked for a status update and I had to scramble to piece it together"

**Context:**
- Usually triggered by team growth (2→4 people) or increased project complexity
- Often happens after a visible failure (missed deadline, dropped ball)

**The Job:**
"When I'm managing multiple workstreams, I need a way to see everything in one place so I don't drop balls and look incompetent."

**Push forces:**
- Spreadsheets getting unwieldy
- Fear of missing deadlines
- Team asking "what should I work on?"

**Pull forces:**
- Dream of a "dashboard" view
- Want to look organized in meetings
- Others recommend tools

**Anxieties:**
- "Will my team actually use it?"
- "Will it take forever to set up?"
- "What if it's more work than my spreadsheet?"

**Habits:**
- Know how to use Excel
- Have existing spreadsheet with all data
- Team knows current system

**Product implications:**
- Must have easy setup (reduce anxiety)
- Must import from spreadsheets (reduce switching cost)
- Must provide "at-a-glance" view (functional job)
- Must make user look organized (social job)

## Key Quotes

> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole. Actually, they want the shelf that goes in the hole. Actually, they want to be organized. Actually, they want their spouse to be happy with them."

> "The struggling moment is everything. If you don't understand what caused someone to start looking, you don't understand the job."

> "Anxiety is often the silent killer of sales. People want your product, but they're afraid it won't work for them."

> "You're not competing with your competitors. You're competing with whatever the customer is doing today - including doing nothing."
