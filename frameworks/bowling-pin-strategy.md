## Overview

Bowling Pin Strategy is a market expansion approach where you dominate narrow segments sequentially, using each victory to fuel the next. Like knocking over bowling pins, you start with a "head pin" (easiest target segment) and use that momentum to knock over adjacent pins (related segments) until you've conquered the broader market.

The insight: trying to win a large market all at once is prohibitively expensive and usually fails. Instead, win small markets completely, then expand from that base of strength. Most successful companies followed this pattern, even if they don't describe it that way.

This strategy is particularly relevant for startups and new products entering established markets, where competing head-on with incumbents is suicide.

## How It Works

### The Bowling Pin Metaphor

```
                    [Lead Pin]
                       /\
                      /  \
                [Pin]    [Pin]
                 /\        /\
                /  \      /  \
           [Pin]  [Pin] [Pin] [Pin]
               \    \    /    /
                \    \  /    /
                 [Bigger Market]
```

**Lead Pin:** Your initial target segment - the easiest to win, often underserved by incumbents

**Adjacent Pins:** Related segments you can expand into once you dominate the lead pin

**Bigger Market:** The ultimate prize - achievable only after you've built position through the pins

### The Process

**Step 1: Identify the Lead Pin**
Find a segment that:
- Is underserved by current market leaders
- Has a painful problem you can solve better than anyone
- Is small enough that incumbents won't fight hard for it
- Has reference-ability to adjacent segments

*Questions to ask:*
- Who has the most urgent need for what we do?
- Which segment do we consistently win in?
- Where do incumbents' solutions fall short?
- Who would be a reference customer for others?

**Step 2: Dominate the Lead Pin**
Go all-in on this segment:
- Tailor product specifically to their needs
- Build deep expertise in their problems
- Become the obvious choice
- Get reference customers and case studies

*What domination looks like:*
- 50%+ market share in the segment
- Word-of-mouth reputation as "the solution for X"
- Competitors don't bother competing in this segment

**Step 3: Map Adjacent Pins**
Identify segments that:
- Trust and reference your lead pin segment
- Have similar (but not identical) needs
- Are a natural expansion of your capabilities
- Are still underserved by incumbents

**Step 4: Knock Over Adjacent Pins**
Expand into adjacent segments:
- Use lead pin success as proof
- Adapt product for new segment needs
- Repeat the domination process

**Step 5: Continue Expansion**
Each pin creates momentum for the next:
- Your reputation grows
- Your capabilities expand
- Incumbents become your challengers, not vice versa

## Example: Classic Bowling Pin Execution

**Company:** Salesforce (original growth story)

**Lead Pin:** CRM for small businesses
- Underserved by Siebel (focused on enterprise)
- Had a real pain point (couldn't afford enterprise software)
- Small enough that Siebel didn't care

**Positioning:** "CRM for very small businesses. No software to install. No IT department needed."

**Adjacent Pin 1:** CRM for SMB
- Once small businesses succeeded, growing companies trusted them
- Added features for growing needs
- Expanded deal sizes

**Adjacent Pin 2:** CRM for Mid-Market
- SMB success created references
- Added enterprise features gradually
- Maintained ease-of-use advantage

**Adjacent Pin 3:** CRM for Enterprise
- Eventually challenged Siebel directly
- By then, had years of momentum and capabilities
- Siebel couldn't adapt fast enough

**Outcome:** Salesforce went from startup to market leader without ever fighting Siebel head-on until they were ready.

## When to Use

**Bowling pin strategy is ideal when:**
- Entering markets with established players
- Limited resources for go-to-market
- Product can be tailored to specific segments
- Adjacent segments trust each other (referenceability)
- You can truly dominate narrow segments

**Signs you need this approach:**
- Trying to be "for everyone" and winning no one
- Competitors consistently outspend you
- Can't get traction in your "main" market
- Win rates vary wildly by segment
- No clear reference customers

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Lead pin too big
If your lead pin is "SMBs" or "tech companies," it's not a pin - it's a market. Real pins are narrow: "Solo consultants building their practice" or "DevOps teams at Series B SaaS companies."

### 2. Lead pin with no adjacencies
A segment that doesn't reference or connect to other segments is a dead end, not a lead pin. Make sure your first win can fuel the next.

### 3. Expanding too early
Moving to adjacent pins before dominating the lead pin creates a weak foundation. You don't have the references, expertise, or reputation to win.

### 4. Expanding too late
Once you've dominated a pin, staying there too long means missing growth. The whole point is expansion.

### 5. Adjacent pins that aren't adjacent
Jumping to unrelated segments throws away your hard-won advantages. True adjacency means shared context, similar needs, and reference-ability.

### 6. Fighting incumbents in their strength
The whole point is to avoid head-on competition until you're ready. If incumbents are fighting hard in your lead pin, you picked the wrong pin.

### 7. Abandoning the lead pin
When you expand, you don't abandon previous pins. They continue to drive revenue and references. Think expansion, not replacement.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** New project management tool planning market entry

**Market analysis:**
- Incumbents: Asana, Monday.com, Jira (all broad, fighting for everyone)
- Pain point identified: Creative agencies struggle with tools designed for engineering

**Lead Pin:** Small creative agencies (5-15 people)
- *Underserved:* Current tools are too technical or too generic
- *Acute pain:* Visual project tracking, client collaboration
- *Reference-able:* Creative agencies talk to each other, share tools
- *Achievable:* Can dominate with focused product and marketing

**Domination strategy:**
- Build features specifically for creative work (visual boards, asset management)
- Price for small agencies
- Become known in creative community (design blogs, agency Slack groups)
- Get 100+ agencies, 50%+ segment share

**Adjacent Pin 1:** Medium creative agencies (15-50 people)
- Use small agency references
- Add features for larger teams (permissions, reporting)
- Same community, larger deals

**Adjacent Pin 2:** In-house creative teams at brands
- Creative agencies work with these teams
- Natural reference point
- Expand into corporate market through creative function

**Adjacent Pin 3:** Marketing teams broadly
- In-house creative sits within marketing
- Expand to content, campaigns, broader marketing ops
- Now competing with Asana/Monday but from strength

**5-year outcome:** Dominant position in creative/marketing PM, built on a foundation of absolute ownership of small creative agencies.

## Key Quotes

> "It's not about going after the biggest market. It's about going after the market you can win completely, then using that to win the next one."

> "Most startups die trying to be 'for everyone.' The survivors usually started by being 'for someone' very specific."

> "If the market leader cares about your target segment, you've picked the wrong target. Find the segment they're neglecting."

> "Category creation looks good in hindsight. In reality, most 'category creators' started as niche players and expanded."
