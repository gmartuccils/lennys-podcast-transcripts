# LNO Framework

**Best for:** Task prioritization and deciding how much effort to invest in different types of work

## Overview

The LNO Framework is a task categorization system that helps you decide how much effort to invest in different types of work. Every task falls into one of three categories: Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead. The key insight is that most people treat all work as equally important, investing maximum effort in everything. This is exhausting and counterproductive.

The framework teaches you to deliberately "satisfice" (do just enough) on Neutral and Overhead tasks so you can invest disproportionately in Leverage tasks. The goal isn't to do less work - it's to do the right work excellently and the rest adequately.

High performers intuitively understand this. They know which tasks deserve their A-game and which tasks just need to get done. The LNO Framework makes this intuition explicit and teachable.

## How It Works

### Leverage (L) Tasks
**Definition:** High-impact work where quality dramatically affects outcomes.

These are tasks where the difference between good and great has massive downstream effects. Extra effort here compounds significantly.

**Characteristics:**
- Quality directly affects important outcomes
- Mistakes are costly or hard to reverse
- Excellence creates disproportionate returns
- Often strategic, creative, or high-stakes

**How to approach:** Invest maximum effort. Do these excellently. Block time for deep work. Don't rush.

**Examples:**
- Product strategy documents
- Critical hiring decisions
- Key customer conversations
- Architecture decisions
- Major feature designs
- Important stakeholder presentations
- Performance reviews for your team

### Neutral (N) Tasks
**Definition:** Work where above-average effort doesn't meaningfully change outcomes.

These are tasks where "good enough" truly is good enough. Perfectionism here is wasted energy.

**Characteristics:**
- Outcomes are similar whether done well or very well
- Process matters more than brilliance
- Often routine or standardized
- Quality ceiling exists - can't over-deliver

**How to approach:** Do these adequately. "Good enough" is the target. Don't over-invest.

**Examples:**
- Most emails (clear and complete beats eloquent)
- Standard status updates
- Routine meeting facilitation
- Documentation that follows templates
- Most internal presentations
- Booking travel
- Scheduling meetings

### Overhead (O) Tasks
**Definition:** Necessary work with minimal impact on outcomes.

These are tasks that must be done but create almost no direct value. They're the cost of operating but not the source of value creation.

**Characteristics:**
- Required but not valuable
- Any effort beyond minimum is wasted
- Often administrative or compliance-related
- No one cares how well you do these

**How to approach:** Do these quickly. Minimize time spent. Automate or delegate if possible.

**Examples:**
- Expense reports
- Time tracking
- Most compliance forms
- Calendar management
- Many internal processes
- Routine approvals
- Some meetings you must attend but can't contribute to

## The Distribution Problem

Most people's natural distribution:
- Leverage: 20% of effort (should be 50%+)
- Neutral: 50% of effort (should be 30%)
- Overhead: 30% of effort (should be 20% or less)

**Why this happens:**
1. **Overhead expands to fill time** - Administrative work is endless if you let it be
2. **Neutral tasks feel productive** - Clearing emails feels like accomplishment
3. **Leverage tasks are hard** - Strategic work is mentally demanding, so we avoid it
4. **Perfectionism on everything** - We're taught that quality always matters

**The rebalancing:**
Consciously lower your standards on N and O tasks to free up energy for L tasks. This feels uncomfortable but is essential for effectiveness.

## When to Use

**Use this framework when:**
- Planning your day or week
- Feeling overwhelmed with tasks
- Noticing you're busy but not impactful
- Deciding how much time to spend on something
- Reviewing how you spent your time

**The daily practice:**
Before starting any task, ask: "Is this L, N, or O?"
- If L: Block focused time, do it well
- If N: Set a time limit, do it adequately
- If O: Do it fast, or batch with other O tasks

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Misclassifying L tasks as N
Some tasks feel routine but are actually leverage. Example: 1:1s with your team might feel like standard meetings (N), but they're actually high-leverage relationship-building moments (L).

### 2. Perfecting N tasks
Spending 2 hours on an email that should take 15 minutes. Over-designing slides for a routine update. Making a standard template "perfect." This is the most common time trap.

### 3. Not acknowledging O tasks exist
Some people feel guilty about overhead work and try to add value to every task. This backfires - it slows you down and doesn't improve outcomes.

### 4. Using LNO to justify low quality
The framework isn't an excuse for sloppy work. N and O tasks still need to be done competently - just not excellently.

### 5. Static categorization
A task's category can change based on context. A standard status update (N) becomes leverage (L) if it's going to the CEO during a crisis. Reassess as situations change.

### 6. Not protecting L time
If you don't actively protect time for leverage work, N and O tasks will consume your day. L tasks require intention and scheduling.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** PM planning their Tuesday

| Task | Initial Gut | LNO Category | Time Allocated |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Quarterly strategy review | Important | L (Leverage) | 3 hours, deep work block |
| Team standup | Routine | N (Neutral) | 30 min, don't over-prepare |
| Expense report | Annoying | O (Overhead) | 15 min, batch at end of day |
| Customer interview | Valuable | L (Leverage) | 1.5 hours including prep |
| Status email to VP | Time-consuming | N (Neutral) | 20 min max, use template |
| Review 3 PRDs | Standard | Depends on PRD | 1 hour for routine, more for critical |
| Sprint planning | Long | N (Neutral) | 1 hour, don't over-engineer |
| Slack catch-up | Endless | O (Overhead) | 20 min, twice per day only |

**Result:** By categorizing explicitly, the PM allocates 4.5 hours to L tasks, maintains quality on N tasks without over-investing, and minimizes O task time.

## Key Quotes

> "Most people treat all work as leverage work. They bring their A-game to everything. This sounds admirable but it's actually ineffective - you burn out and still don't have enough energy for what truly matters."

> "The hardest part of LNO is giving yourself permission to do B-minus work on Neutral tasks. It feels wrong. But it's the only way to have energy for A-plus work on Leverage tasks."

> "Every hour you spend perfecting a Neutral task is an hour stolen from Leverage work."

> "Overhead tasks are like weeds - they'll grow to fill whatever time you give them. Contain them aggressively."

## The Permission Slip

If you struggle to lower your standards on N and O tasks, try this reframe:

**Old belief:** "I should do everything well. That's what it means to be professional."

**New belief:** "Being professional means knowing where excellence matters. Doing everything well means doing nothing excellently."

Give yourself explicit permission to:
- Send emails that are clear but not eloquent
- Run meetings that are effective but not exceptional
- Complete forms quickly without double-checking
- Say "this is good enough" and move on
