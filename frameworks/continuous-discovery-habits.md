# Continuous Discovery Habits

**Best for:** Building sustainable research practices that inform product decisions

## Overview

Continuous Discovery Habits is a system for making customer research a regular, ongoing practice rather than a periodic event. The core principle: product teams should have at least one customer touchpoint per week, every week. This continuous stream of customer input prevents teams from building products in a vacuum.

The traditional approach to research - quarterly studies, big upfront projects - creates gaps where teams make assumptions instead of learning from customers. Continuous discovery closes these gaps by building research into the weekly rhythm of product development.

The framework emphasizes small, frequent learning over big, infrequent studies. It's better to interview one customer every week than ten customers every quarter.

## How It Works

### The Core Habit: Weekly Customer Touchpoints

**The commitment:** At least one substantive customer conversation per week, every week, involving the entire product trio (PM, designer, engineer).

**Why weekly?**
- Frequent enough to stay connected to customer reality
- Sustainable - doesn't require massive coordination
- Creates habit formation
- Catches problems before they compound

**What counts as a touchpoint:**
- Customer interviews (primary)
- Usability tests
- Customer support shadowing
- Site visits
- Sales call observation
- Any direct customer interaction where you learn something

### The Discovery Cadence

Teresa Torres recommends a weekly rhythm:

**Interview:** Talk to at least one customer about their experiences and needs

**Synthesize:** Update your opportunity solution tree with what you learned

**Ideate:** Generate solutions for promising opportunities

**Test:** Run assumption tests on your riskiest beliefs

**Decide:** Choose what to build based on evidence

This cycle repeats weekly, creating a continuous learning loop.

### Recruiting for Continuous Interviews

The biggest obstacle to continuous discovery is finding customers to talk to. Solve this with:

**Automated recruiting:**
- In-app intercepts: "Would you chat with us for 15 min? Get $20 credit"
- Post-transaction surveys with interview opt-in
- NPS follow-ups: "You rated us X. Would you tell us why?"

**Continuous recruiting sources:**
- New signups (within first week)
- Customers who just completed key actions
- Churned customers (gold mine)
- Support ticket closures
- Power users and edge cases

**The pool:** Build a standing list of customers willing to talk. Always be adding to it.

### Interview Structure for Continuous Discovery

Since you're interviewing weekly, each interview can be focused:

**Opening (5 min):**
- Build rapport
- Explain purpose
- Get permission to record

**Core exploration (20-30 min):**
- Focus on one topic/opportunity area
- Use story-based questions
- Dig into specific recent experiences

**Closing (5 min):**
- Any final thoughts
- Thank them
- Ask if they'd be willing to talk again

**Key difference from big research studies:** You don't need comprehensive coverage in each interview. You're building understanding over time across many interviews.

### Assumption Testing

Beyond interviews, continuous discovery involves constantly testing assumptions:

**Types of assumptions:**
- **Desirability:** Will customers want this?
- **Usability:** Can customers use this?
- **Feasibility:** Can we build this?
- **Viability:** Will this work for the business?

**Assumption test principles:**
- Test the riskiest assumption first
- Use the smallest test that gives you confidence
- Set success criteria before running the test
- Time-box (don't let tests drag on)

**Example tests:**
- Fake door test: Does anyone click on a feature that doesn't exist yet?
- Prototype test: Can users complete the task with a low-fi mockup?
- Smoke test: Will people pay for this before we build it?
- Concierge test: Deliver the value manually before automating

## When to Use

**Continuous discovery is appropriate when:**
- You're building products with ongoing development (not one-time projects)
- Customer needs are complex or changing
- You have access to customers (B2C, B2B with engaged customers)
- Your team is empowered to make product decisions

**Signs you need continuous discovery:**
- Features ship but don't get adopted
- Team argues about what customers want
- Roadmap is driven by stakeholder opinions, not customer needs
- Research happens only when something's "broken"
- Long gaps between customer conversations

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Batch interviewing instead of continuous
Doing 10 interviews one week, then nothing for two months. The point is the habit, not the volume. One per week, every week.

### 2. Only PMs do interviews
The entire product trio should participate. When engineers and designers hear customer pain directly, they make better decisions autonomously.

### 3. Interviewing only happy customers
You need to talk to:
- New customers (what attracted them?)
- Churned customers (what went wrong?)
- Non-customers (why didn't they choose you?)
- Power users (what would make them love you more?)
- Struggling users (where do they get stuck?)

### 4. Not synthesizing
Interviews without synthesis are waste. After each interview, update your understanding:
- What opportunities did we discover?
- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?
- What should we explore next?

### 5. Using interviews to validate, not discover
Coming into interviews trying to prove your solution is right, instead of genuinely exploring customer needs. Let the customer surprise you.

### 6. Not involving the team in decisions
Continuous discovery works when insights inform decisions. If leadership ignores the research and builds what they want anyway, the practice erodes.

### 7. Treating assumption tests as validation
An assumption test is designed to find problems, not to prove you're right. If you're always "validating," you're probably confirming your biases.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** B2B SaaS team implementing continuous discovery

**Week 1:**
- **Interview:** New customer (2 weeks post-signup) about onboarding experience
- **Learning:** Users confused by terminology in setup wizard
- **Opportunity added:** "Users don't understand our jargon during setup"

**Week 2:**
- **Interview:** Churned customer about why they left
- **Learning:** Never understood the reporting feature
- **Opportunity added:** "Users don't discover our most valuable features"

**Week 3:**
- **Interview:** Power user about workflow
- **Learning:** They export data to Excel for analysis we could do in-app
- **Opportunity added:** "Users need analysis capabilities they're doing manually"

**Week 4:**
- **Ideation session:** Generate solutions for top opportunity
- **Assumption test:** Prototype test of new onboarding flow with 3 users

**Cumulative effect:** After 12 weeks, the team has:
- Talked to 12+ customers
- Identified 8 validated opportunities
- Tested 4 solution concepts
- Shipped 2 features with high confidence

## Building the Habit

### Start small
- Week 1: Do one interview
- Week 2: Do one interview and debrief with team
- Week 3: Do one interview, debrief, and update OST
- Week 4+: Full cycle

### Remove friction
- Set up automated recruiting
- Block a consistent time weekly
- Create simple templates
- Have a designated interview tool

### Make it visible
- Share learnings in team channels
- Update a public opportunity board
- Celebrate insights (not just ships)

### Protect the time
- Make interviews a non-negotiable calendar block
- Involve leadership so they protect it
- Track streak: "We've talked to customers X weeks in a row"

## Key Quotes

> "If you're not talking to customers every week, you're building on assumptions. Some of those assumptions will be wrong, and you won't find out until after you've shipped."

> "The teams that talk to customers weekly don't argue about what to build. The evidence makes the decisions obvious."

> "Continuous discovery isn't about doing more research. It's about making research a habit instead of a project."

> "I'd rather have a team that does one mediocre interview per week than one that does a perfect research study once a quarter."
