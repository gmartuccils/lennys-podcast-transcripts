# Founder Mode

**Source:** Brian Chesky (CEO of Airbnb)
**Best for:** Maintaining quality and alignment as companies scale

## Overview

Founder Mode is an operating philosophy where company leaders stay deeply involved in product details rather than delegating to autonomous teams. It challenges the conventional wisdom that CEOs should "hire great people and get out of the way." Brian Chesky rebuilt Airbnb during COVID using this approach, fundamentally changing how the company operates.

The insight: as companies scale, they often lose the focus and quality that made them successful. Leaders become removed from the product, communication fractures across divisions, and mediocrity creeps in. Founder Mode is a deliberate choice to stay in the details, maintain a single roadmap, and hold work to a high standard.

This isn't micromanagement - it's about caring deeply and being present. The CEO doesn't make every decision but does review every important one.

## How It Works

### The Core Principles

**1. Be in the Details**
Leaders should review work directly, not just receive summaries from managers.

*Traditional:* CEO gets executive summary → Directors present filtered version → Actual work is invisible to leadership

*Founder Mode:* CEO reviews actual designs, actual features, actual customer feedback. Direct engagement with the work.

*Why it matters:* Details compound. Small quality issues become product-wide problems. Leaders who don't see details can't ensure quality.

**2. One Roadmap**
The entire company operates on a single, shared roadmap that everyone can see.

*Traditional:* Each team has their own roadmap → Coordination happens in meetings → No one sees the full picture

*Founder Mode:* One roadmap visible to everyone → CEO reviews it weekly → Priorities are explicit and shared

*Why it matters:* Fragmented roadmaps lead to fragmented products. A single roadmap forces prioritization and alignment.

**3. Functional Model**
Organize by function (engineering, design, marketing) not just product areas.

*Traditional:* Cross-functional squads own product areas → Each squad operates independently

*Founder Mode:* Functions (design, engineering) maintain quality standards across product areas → Functional leaders ensure consistency

*Why it matters:* Squads optimize locally. Functional leadership ensures consistent quality and standards across the product.

**4. Weekly Review Cadence**
Leaders review work-in-progress regularly, not just at launch.

*Structure:*
- Weekly roadmap review with leadership
- Design reviews where CEO sees actual work
- Product reviews before features ship

*Why it matters:* Problems caught early are cheap to fix. Problems caught at launch are expensive.

**5. Ship Less, Better**
Fewer, higher-quality launches beat many mediocre ones.

*Traditional:* Teams ship constantly to show velocity

*Founder Mode:* Everything that ships must be excellent. If it's not ready, it doesn't ship.

*Why it matters:* One bad experience damages trust more than one good experience builds it.

### What Founder Mode Looks Like

**In Practice:**
- CEO attends design reviews and gives direct feedback
- Marketing campaigns are reviewed by leadership before launch
- Single product roadmap visible to entire company
- Weekly all-hands covering what's shipping and why
- Leaders use the product extensively themselves
- Quality bars are explicit and enforced

**What It's Not:**
- Leaders making every decision (teams still have ownership)
- Chaos and constant pivoting (discipline, not whims)
- Only founders can do it (the "mode" can be adopted by anyone)

## The Airbnb Story

Brian Chesky developed Founder Mode during Airbnb's COVID crisis:

**The Crisis (2020):**
- Travel collapsed overnight
- Had to lay off 25% of the company
- Needed to completely refocus

**The Transformation:**
1. Eliminated divisional structure
2. Created single product roadmap
3. CEO started reviewing all major work
4. Killed hundreds of initiatives, focused on core
5. Rebuilt company around fewer, better launches

**The Result:**
- Airbnb went public despite pandemic
- Best financial performance in company history
- Product quality dramatically improved
- Company aligned and focused

## When to Use

**Founder Mode is valuable when:**
- Company has lost focus (doing too many things)
- Quality has degraded
- Teams are disconnected from overall vision
- Products feel fragmented
- Leadership is out of touch with actual work
- Major transformation is needed

**Founder Mode is harder when:**
- Leader lacks product/design judgment
- Company is too large for one person to see everything
- Trust between leadership and teams is broken
- Leader can't commit the time

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Micromanagement disguised as Founder Mode
Being in the details to support quality is different from making every decision. Teams still need ownership.

### 2. Details without decision authority
If you're reviewing everything but can't change anything, you're just creating overhead.

### 3. Inconsistent engagement
Being deeply involved sometimes and absent other times is worse than consistent delegation. Pick a mode and stick with it.

### 4. Not building functional leadership
Founder Mode at Airbnb works because there are strong functional leaders (Head of Design, etc.) who maintain standards. One person can't do it all.

### 5. Forgetting to live the product
Being in the details means using the product yourself. Leaders who don't use their own product can't judge quality.

### 6. Treating all details equally
You can't review everything. Focus on the details that matter most: customer-facing quality, brand, strategic initiatives.

### 7. Burnout
Founder Mode is demanding. Without strong functional leaders and disciplined focus, it's unsustainable.

## Implementing Founder Mode

### Step 1: Simplify
Cut initiatives until there's a manageable number. You can't be in the details of 100 projects.

### Step 2: Create the Single Roadmap
Build a unified roadmap that shows everything the company is working on. Make it visible to everyone.

### Step 3: Establish Review Cadences
Set up regular reviews where leadership sees actual work:
- Weekly roadmap review
- Design reviews (bi-weekly)
- Launch reviews (before any release)

### Step 4: Build Functional Excellence
Hire or develop strong functional leaders who can maintain quality standards across the product.

### Step 5: Live the Product
Use the product constantly. Have leadership team do the same. Direct experience with quality is essential.

### Step 6: Protect Focus
Say no to things that don't serve the core. Kill projects aggressively. Focus is a muscle.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** B2B SaaS company applying Founder Mode principles

**Before:**
- 6 product teams, each with own roadmap
- CEO gets updates in deck form
- Design quality varies by team
- Teams ship frequently but metrics aren't moving

**After - Founder Mode Implementation:**

*Simplified:*
- Cut from 30 initiatives to 10
- Killed features that weren't core

*Single Roadmap:*
- Created one roadmap document
- All teams contribute to same document
- CEO reviews weekly with leadership

*Review Cadence:*
- Monday: Roadmap review
- Wednesday: Design review (CEO attends 2 of 4)
- Friday: Product demo of what's shipping

*Functional Excellence:*
- Hired Head of Design to maintain standards
- Design reviews required before engineering starts

*Quality Bar:*
- Nothing ships without leadership review
- Delayed launches that weren't ready
- Customer feedback reviewed weekly

**Result after 6 months:**
- Fewer launches but NPS increased significantly
- Team more focused and less burned out
- CEO has actual product knowledge
- Company aligned on what matters

## Key Quotes

> "The conventional wisdom is wrong. 'Hire great people and get out of the way' sounds good but leads to fragmentation. Great people need direction and alignment."

> "Being in the details isn't micromanagement. Micromanagement is making decisions for people. Being in the details is caring enough to see the work and hold it to a high standard."

> "One roadmap forces prioritization. When everything is visible, you can't hide. You have to make hard choices about what matters."

> "World-class results come from world-class effort at every level. If leadership doesn't care about the details, why would anyone else?"
