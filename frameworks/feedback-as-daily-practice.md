## Overview

Feedback as Daily Practice is an approach to team development where feedback isn't confined to performance reviews but happens constantly, in the moment, as a natural part of working together. The insight: teams that give each other feedback regularly get better faster. Teams that wait for formal reviews miss opportunities and let issues fester.

This framework shifts feedback from a formal, uncomfortable event to a collaborative gift. When feedback is frequent and expected, it loses its sting and becomes a tool for growth. The best teams don't treat feedback as criticism - they treat it as calibration.

The key is establishing feedback as a relationship norm early, so it's expected and welcome rather than surprising and threatening.

## How It Works

### The Mindset Shift

**Old Paradigm:**
- Feedback happens in performance reviews
- Feedback is evaluative and judgmental
- Giving feedback is hard; receiving it is defensive
- Feedback comes from managers to reports

**New Paradigm:**
- Feedback happens daily
- Feedback is developmental and helpful
- Giving and receiving feedback is a shared skill
- Feedback flows in all directions

### The Three Keys

**1. Establish the Relationship First**
Before you ever need to give difficult feedback, establish that your relationship is one where you help each other grow.

*Early conversation:*
"I'm excited to work with you. I want us to have a relationship where we can be direct with each other. I'll share what I see - both strengths and areas to work on - and I hope you'll do the same for me. Sound good?"

This opt-in makes future feedback expected, not surprising.

**2. Check Your Intention**
Before giving feedback, ask: "Why do I want to say this?"

*Valid intentions:*
- I want to help them improve
- I want to share something that will help them succeed
- I see something they can't see themselves

*Invalid intentions:*
- I want to be right
- I want to punish them
- I'm angry and need to vent
- I want to prove I'm smarter

If your intention isn't genuinely helpful, don't give the feedback yet. Wait until you can do it from the right place.

**3. Name the Difficulty**
When giving hard feedback, acknowledge that it's hard. This humanizes the moment and builds trust.

*Example:*
"I'm nervous to share this because I really value our relationship, and I don't want you to feel bad. But I think this will help you, so I want to say it..."

This vulnerability makes the receiver more open because they see you taking a risk to help them.

### The Feedback Loop

```
[Observe] → [Check Intention] → [Share] → [Invite Response] → [Appreciate]
```

**Observe:** Notice something specific - a behavior, decision, or pattern

**Check Intention:** Am I sharing this to help them or for another reason?

**Share:** Describe what you observed and its impact (use "I" language)

**Invite Response:** Ask for their perspective. You might be wrong.

**Appreciate:** Thank them for listening. Feedback is a gift in both directions.

### Receiving Feedback Well

Receiving feedback is a skill too:

**1. Listen fully before responding**
Don't plan your defense while they're talking. Actually hear them.

**2. Assume positive intent**
They're taking a risk to help you. Start there.

**3. Ask clarifying questions**
"Can you give me a specific example?"
"What would you have done differently?"

**4. Appreciate the gift**
"Thank you for telling me. That's helpful."

**5. Decide what to do with it**
You don't have to accept all feedback. But you should consider it honestly.

## When to Use

**Daily feedback is appropriate for:**
- In-the-moment coaching
- Recognizing good work
- Addressing small issues before they become big
- Building team growth culture
- Any ongoing working relationship

**More formal feedback is appropriate for:**
- Performance evaluations (summaries of ongoing feedback)
- Career conversations
- Serious performance issues
- When documentation is needed

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Never establishing the relationship
Hitting someone with feedback out of nowhere feels like an attack. Set up the relationship first.

### 2. Feedback only when things are wrong
If people only hear from you when there's criticism, feedback becomes scary. Balance critical with positive. Recognize good work too.

### 3. Vague feedback
"You could communicate better" is useless. Specific feedback: "In yesterday's meeting, when you interrupted Sarah, I saw her shut down. What were you trying to accomplish?"

### 4. Feedback from a bad place
If you're angry, frustrated, or trying to win an argument, wait. Bad intention poisons good feedback.

### 5. Feedback sandwich
Don't hide criticism between compliments (the "shit sandwich"). It's manipulative and people learn to distrust your compliments.

### 6. Only downward feedback
Feedback should flow up, down, and laterally. If reports never give feedback to managers, you're missing valuable perspective.

### 7. Not following up
Feedback without follow-up is incomplete. "How's that thing we discussed going?" shows you care about their growth.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** PM notices designer missing deadlines

**Bad approach:**
Waiting for performance review, then: "You've been missing deadlines all quarter. That's unacceptable."

**Good approach:**

*Week 1 - After first missed deadline:*
"Hey, I noticed the mockups came in two days late. Is everything okay? I want to understand what happened so we can figure out if I can help."

*If it continues - Week 2:*
"I'm a little worried because this is the second deadline that's slipped. I care about your success here, and I want to help figure out what's going on. Can we talk about it?"

*Follow-up conversation:*
"What's making it hard to hit dates? Is the scope too big? Are you blocked on something? Are there things on your plate I don't know about?"

*Outcome:*
Discover the designer is overloaded with side requests. Work together to reduce scope and protect their time.

*Two weeks later:*
"I wanted to say that since we cleaned up your plate, the last two deliveries have been right on time. That's great to see."

## The Daily Practice

### Building the Habit

**Week 1-2: Observe**
Start noticing moments where feedback would be helpful. Don't give it yet - just observe.

**Week 3-4: Small positives**
Start giving positive feedback in the moment. "Great point in that meeting" or "That design really solved the user problem well."

**Week 5-6: Small constructive**
Start giving small constructive feedback. "One thought on that email - the ask was buried. What if you led with it?"

**Week 7+: Full practice**
Feedback becomes natural, expected, and constant. Mix of positive and constructive. Team starts giving feedback to each other and to you.

### Making Time

- 5-minute debrief after meetings: "What went well? What could we do differently?"
- Weekly 1:1s with explicit feedback time: "Anything I should know about my performance this week?"
- Project retros: "What should I keep doing? Stop doing? Start doing?"

## Key Quotes

> "Feedback is a gift. The person giving it is taking a risk to help you see something you can't see yourself."

> "The best teams give each other feedback constantly. They don't wait for formal reviews. By the time the review comes, there are no surprises."

> "If you're nervous about giving feedback, say that out loud. 'I'm nervous to share this because I value our relationship.' That vulnerability makes the feedback land better."

> "Most people don't get enough feedback. They're operating blind. If you can build a culture where feedback is normal and expected, your team will get better faster than anyone else."
