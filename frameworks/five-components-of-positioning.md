# Five Components of Positioning

**Best for:** Defining how customers understand and categorize your product

## Overview

Positioning is the act of defining how your product is the best in the world at providing some value that a well-defined set of customers cares about. It's not a tagline or a marketing message - it's the foundational strategic work that makes everything else (messaging, sales, marketing) coherent.

April Dunford's framework breaks positioning into five interconnected components that must be worked through in a specific order. The magic is in the sequence: your competitive alternatives determine everything else.

Most products fail at positioning not because they lack features or quality, but because customers don't understand what they are or why they matter. Good positioning makes your value obvious.

## How It Works

### The Five Components (In Order)

```
[1. Competitive Alternatives]
          ↓
[2. Unique Attributes]
          ↓
[3. Value]
          ↓
[4. Target Customers]
          ↓
[5. Market Category]
```

**You MUST work through these in order.** Each component depends on the ones above it.

### Component 1: Competitive Alternatives
**Question:** What would customers do if your product didn't exist?

This is NOT your preferred competitor list. It's what customers actually consider, which might include:
- Direct competitors
- Adjacent products
- Manual processes ("I'll use a spreadsheet")
- Doing nothing

**Why it comes first:**
Your differentiation only matters relative to what customers would otherwise choose. If you're comparing yourself to the wrong alternative, your positioning will miss.

**Example:** A new email marketing tool might think its competitor is Mailchimp. But for small businesses, the real alternative might be "not doing email marketing at all" or "using Gmail manually."

### Component 2: Unique Attributes
**Question:** What features/capabilities do you have that alternatives lack?

These are factual, provable things about your product:
- Features
- Technology
- Team expertise
- Data assets
- Integrations
- Business model differences

**Focus on differences:** Listing features you share with competitors doesn't help positioning. Only list what's unique to you.

**Example:**
- "Our algorithm processes data 10x faster"
- "We're the only tool that integrates with Salesforce AND HubSpot"
- "Our team built security systems for banks for 20 years"

### Component 3: Value
**Question:** What benefit do those unique attributes enable for customers?

Translate features into customer outcomes:
- Feature: "10x faster processing" → Value: "Get reports in seconds instead of hours"
- Feature: "Bank-level security" → Value: "Never worry about data breaches"

**The value must be real:**
If you can't clearly articulate why your unique attributes matter to customers, they probably don't matter.

**Differentiated value** is the intersection of:
- Something you do uniquely well
- Something customers actually care about

### Component 4: Target Customers
**Question:** Who cares most about that differentiated value?

Not everyone will value your differentiation equally. Target customers are those who:
- Feel the pain your value addresses acutely
- Would pay a premium for your differentiation
- Are reachable and serviceable

**Characteristics to define:**
- Company size/stage
- Industry vertical
- Specific role/function
- Current tools/processes
- Triggering event or situation

**Example:** "Head of Marketing at B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees who just started doing content marketing and need to prove ROI"

### Component 5: Market Category
**Question:** What context makes your value obvious?

The market category helps customers understand what you are and sets expectations. It provides:
- A mental model for what the product does
- A reference point for comparison
- Expectations for pricing, features, competition

**Category options:**
- **Existing category:** "We're a CRM" (clear, but invites comparison)
- **Subcategory:** "We're a CRM for real estate" (narrower, less competition)
- **Adjacent category:** "We're project management for creative teams" (borrowed context)
- **New category:** "We're customer success automation" (requires education)

**Default to existing categories** unless you have a strong reason not to. Creating a new category is expensive and risky.

## The Positioning Process

### Step 1: Gather the right people
Cross-functional team: product, marketing, sales, leadership. You need people who talk to customers.

### Step 2: List competitive alternatives
Interview recent customers: "What would you have done if we didn't exist?" Look for patterns.

### Step 3: List unique attributes
Be ruthlessly honest. Only list what's truly different, not what's table stakes.

### Step 4: Map attributes to value
For each attribute, ask: "So what? Why does this matter to customers?"

### Step 5: Identify best-fit customers
Who cares most about this value? Where do we consistently win deals?

### Step 6: Choose market category
What context makes our value most obvious? Test with customers.

### Step 7: Document and test
Write up your positioning. Test it with sales team. Refine based on customer response.

## When to Use

**Positioning work is needed when:**
- Launching a new product
- Entering a new market
- Sales conversations aren't converting
- Marketing messages aren't resonating
- Customers are confused about what you do
- You're losing to competitors you think you should beat
- Growth has stalled

**Signs of weak positioning:**
- "What is this?" is a common reaction
- Customers compare you unfavorably to wrong competitors
- Sales cycles are long and confused
- Win rate varies wildly by deal
- Marketing campaigns don't resonate

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Starting with market category
Most people start by saying "we're a [category]" then try to fit everything else. This is backwards. Category should be the last decision.

### 2. Listing features that aren't unique
"We have great customer support" - so does everyone. Only positioning-worthy attributes are truly different.

### 3. Ignoring real competitive alternatives
You don't choose your competitors - customers do. If customers compare you to spreadsheets, position against spreadsheets, not against other software.

### 4. Confusing features with value
"AI-powered" is a feature. "Save 10 hours per week" is value. Customers buy value, not features.

### 5. Targeting everyone
"Anyone who uses email" is not a target customer. Narrow focus beats broad reach for positioning.

### 6. Forcing category creation
Creating a new category is expensive and usually unnecessary. Most successful companies didn't create their categories - they dominated segments of existing ones.

### 7. Positioning by committee
Too many opinions lead to bland, undifferentiated positioning. Strong positioning is specific and will feel uncomfortable to generalists.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** B2B analytics tool doing positioning exercise

**Component 1: Competitive Alternatives**
From customer interviews:
- Excel/Google Sheets (most common)
- Looker (enterprise)
- Manual data pulling
- Hiring an analyst

**Component 2: Unique Attributes**
- No-code setup (vs. Looker requiring engineers)
- Pre-built dashboards for SaaS metrics (vs. Excel starting from scratch)
- Automatic data connections to popular tools (Stripe, HubSpot, etc.)

**Component 3: Value**
- "Get your SaaS metrics dashboard running in 10 minutes, not weeks"
- "See all your key metrics in one place without hiring a data analyst"
- "Make data-driven decisions without SQL or engineering help"

**Component 4: Target Customers**
- SaaS companies, $1M-$10M ARR
- No dedicated data team yet
- CEO/Head of Ops who needs visibility
- Just hit growth phase where "gut feel" isn't enough

**Component 5: Market Category**
Options considered:
- Business Intelligence (too broad, invites Tableau comparison)
- SaaS Analytics Platform (clearer, sets right expectations)
- "Self-service BI for SaaS" (subcategory approach)

**Final positioning:**
"For growing SaaS companies without data teams, [Product] is the self-service analytics platform that gives you a complete metrics dashboard in minutes, not months. Unlike traditional BI tools that require engineers, or spreadsheets that require constant maintenance, [Product] automatically connects to your existing tools and shows you exactly what's driving your growth."

## Key Quotes

> "Positioning isn't a tagline or a vision statement. It's the strategic foundation that makes everything else - messaging, marketing, sales - actually work."

> "You don't get to choose your competitors. Customers decide what they compare you to. Your job is to understand that and position against reality, not your preferred competitive set."

> "Weak positioning is the cause of most marketing and sales problems. Before you change your messaging, fix your positioning."

> "Category creation is a choice, not an inevitability. Most successful companies won by dominating segments of existing categories, not by creating new ones."
