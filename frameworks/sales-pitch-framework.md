# Sales Pitch Framework

**Best for:** Structuring sales conversations that help customers understand your value

## Overview

The Sales Pitch Framework is a methodology for structuring sales conversations that transforms positioning into a persuasive pitch. Most sales pitches fail because they focus on the product instead of helping customers understand why the product matters to them.

April Dunford's approach flips the traditional pitch structure. Instead of leading with "here's what we do," you lead with context that helps customers understand why they should care. By the time you introduce your product, customers already agree with the criteria for evaluating solutions - criteria your product uniquely satisfies.

The key insight: your job isn't to sell. Your job is to help customers understand their options and make a confident decision. Most B2B deals are lost to "no decision," not to competitors. A good pitch removes the confusion that causes indecision.

## How It Works

### The Two-Phase Structure

The pitch divides into two main phases: **Setup** (context before product) and **Follow-Through** (product and proof).

```
SETUP                          FOLLOW-THROUGH
├── Insight                    ├── Introduction
├── Alternative Approaches     ├── Differentiated Value
├── Perfect World             ├── Proof
                              ├── Objections
                              └── The Ask
```

**Time allocation:** In a 30-minute call, spend at least 15 minutes on Setup before introducing your product.

### Phase 1: Setup

**Step 1: Insight**
Start with your unique point of view on the market or problem - something that reframes how customers think.

*Not a generic trend.* Not "data is growing exponentially" (everyone knows that). An insight is your specific perspective that leads naturally to why your approach matters.

*Examples:*
- "Most companies treat customer service as a cost center. We believe it's a growth driver - the best companies turn support into sales."
- "Enterprise security has focused on keeping threats out. But 90% of breaches start with compromised credentials inside the organization."

**Step 2: Alternative Approaches**
Walk through the other ways customers could solve this problem. Be honest about pros AND cons.

*This builds trust.* Customers know you're not just pushing your product. They see you understand their options.

*Example:*
"Companies typically handle this three ways:
1. **Shared inbox (Gmail, Outlook)** - Familiar, free, but doesn't scale and you lose track of conversations
2. **Traditional help desk (Zendesk)** - Powerful but expensive and complex, designed for large support teams
3. **All-in-one platforms** - Can be great but often try to do too much and nothing well"

**Step 3: Perfect World**
Get agreement on what an ideal solution should look like. Frame criteria that your product uniquely satisfies.

*This is the bridge.* If customers agree with your "perfect world" criteria, and your product delivers on them, you've won before introducing yourself.

*Example:*
"So in a perfect world, you'd want something that's:
- As easy to use as email
- Scales as you grow without needing to rip and replace
- Built specifically for digital businesses like yours
...does that sound right?"

**Customer says yes.** Now you've set up the evaluation criteria in your favor.

### Phase 2: Follow-Through

**Step 4: Introduction**
Briefly introduce your company and market category.

*Keep it short.* You've already done the heavy lifting. Just provide context.

*Example:* "So that's why we built [Product]. We're customer service software designed specifically for digital businesses."

**Step 5: Differentiated Value**
This is the bulk of the pitch - demonstrate how you deliver on the "perfect world" criteria.

*Structure:*
- For each criterion, show the feature that delivers it
- Connect feature → benefit
- Use the product (demo) or concrete examples

*Time:* In a 30-minute call, this might be 12-15 minutes.

**Step 6: Proof**
Back up your claims with evidence.

*Types of proof:*
- Customer case studies
- Third-party data
- Industry recognition
- Security certifications
- Before/after metrics

*Example:* "Here's how [Similar Company] used this - they went from 40 tickets/day to handling 200 while reducing response time by 60%."

**Step 7: Objections**
Handle concerns that might prevent a decision.

*Common objections:*
- "What if my team doesn't adopt it?"
- "What about IT/security approval?"
- "What about integration with our existing tools?"

*Don't wait for objections.* Address common ones proactively.

**Step 8: The Ask**
End with a clear next step.

*Be specific:*
- "Would it help to do a pilot with your team?"
- "Should we schedule a call with your IT team to address security questions?"
- "What would you need to see to move forward?"

## When to Use

**This framework is ideal for:**
- B2B sales conversations
- Complex or considered purchases
- Products with multiple competitors
- Markets where buyers are confused about options
- Sales cycles with multiple stakeholders

**Signs your pitch needs this framework:**
- High "no decision" rate
- Customers can't articulate why you're different
- Competitors win on features you also have
- Sales cycles are long and confused
- Different reps pitch completely different things

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Skipping the Setup
Jumping straight to "let me show you our product" skips the context that makes customers care. The Setup is the pitch. The product demo is just confirmation.

### 2. Generic insight
"Digital transformation is accelerating" isn't an insight. An insight is a specific point of view that your competitors don't share and that leads to your differentiation.

### 3. Being unfair to alternatives
If you trash competitors, you lose trust. Be honest about their strengths. Customers already know. Your candor builds credibility.

### 4. Perfect world that doesn't favor you
The criteria you propose must lead to your differentiation. If your "perfect world" could be equally satisfied by competitors, you've set up the pitch wrong.

### 5. Feature-dumping in Follow-Through
The differentiated value section should focus on what makes you unique, not a comprehensive feature tour. If competitors have the feature too, skip it.

### 6. Weak proof
"Our customers love us" isn't proof. Specific metrics, named customers, and concrete outcomes are proof.

### 7. No clear ask
Ending with "so, what do you think?" creates awkwardness. Have a specific next step in mind.

## Example Application

**Scenario:** Selling a B2B email security product

**Setup:**

*Insight:*
"Most companies focus security on the perimeter - firewalls, access controls, keeping threats out. But here's what we've learned: 93% of successful breaches start with a phishing email that someone inside the company clicked. The threat is already inside. The question is whether you catch it before damage is done."

*Alternative approaches:*
"Companies typically handle this in a few ways:
1. **Training** - Teach employees to spot phishing. Good in theory, but humans make mistakes, especially when emails are sophisticated.
2. **Traditional email security** - Spam filters and gateway solutions. They catch obvious threats but miss targeted attacks.
3. **Manual review** - IT reviews suspicious emails. Doesn't scale, and the delay means threats often get through."

*Perfect world:*
"In an ideal world, you'd want:
- Something that catches threats training misses
- Without slowing down legitimate email
- That actually gets smarter over time instead of relying on known threats
- And that doesn't require your IT team to babysit it constantly

Would you agree those are the right criteria?"

**Follow-Through:**

*Introduction:*
"That's exactly why we built [Product]. We're AI-powered email security that catches threats your existing tools miss."

*Differentiated value:*
"Let me show you how we deliver on each of those:
[Demo showing AI detection, low false positives, automated learning, and dashboard simplicity]"

*Proof:*
"Here's a case study from [Similar Company]. They were seeing 200 phishing attempts per month getting through their existing tools. After implementing us, that dropped to 2. Here's a quote from their CISO about the implementation."

*Objection handling:*
"You might be wondering about deployment - we integrate with your existing email in about 30 minutes, no changes to your infrastructure."

*Ask:*
"Would it make sense to run a 2-week pilot where we show you what's getting through your current tools? No commitment, just visibility."

## Key Quotes

> "Most B2B deals are lost to 'no decision,' not to competitors. Your job isn't to beat the competition - it's to help customers make a confident decision."

> "The Setup is where you win or lose. By the time you introduce your product, customers should already believe in the criteria you're about to satisfy."

> "If you've set up the pitch correctly, the Follow-Through is just confirmation. Customers should be nodding, not questioning."

> "Teach customers how to buy. They're drowning in options and don't know how to evaluate them. Give them a framework that happens to favor you."
